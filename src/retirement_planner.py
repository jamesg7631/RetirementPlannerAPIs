# Quick Calculation. I forget to model inflation but I want to build the rest of the application to get a quick
# prototype. Model inflation and adjust the below later
# Also, the below uses the model portfolios risk 1-10 model portfolios. However, client could have other funds.
# Could do historical bootstrapping using the yahoo finance API of the fund they are invested in.
# Could potentially break the application though if they request a fund which has an unexpected data format.
# Could result in incorrect calc as a currency conversion could be missed.
# Alternatively, could map fund to our asset classes and use that as the below.
